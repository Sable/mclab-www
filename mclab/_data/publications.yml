- title: "Mc2For: A tool for automatically translating MATLAB to FORTRAN 95"
  link: "http://www.sable.mcgill.ca/publications/papers/2014-1/wcre14-xuli.pdf" 
  type: "Paper" 
  abstract: "MATLAB is a dynamic numerical scripting language widely used by
      scientists, engineers and students. While MATLAB's high-level syntax and
      dynamic types make it ideal for prototyping, programmers often prefer using
      high-performance static languages such as FORTRAN for their final distributable
      code. Rather than rewriting the code by hand, our solution is to provide a tool
      that automatically translates the original MATLAB program to an equivalent
      FORTRAN program. There are several important challenges for automatically
      translating MATLAB to FORTRAN, such as correctly estimating the static type
      characteristics of all the variables in a MATLAB program, mapping MATLAB
      built-in functions, and effectively mapping MATLAB constructs to equivalent
      FORTRAN constructs.   

   
      In this paper, we introduce Mc2FOR, a tool which automatically translates
      MATLAB to FORTRAN. This tool consists of two major parts. The first part is an
      interprocedural analysis component to estimate the static type characteristics,
      such as the shape of arrays and the range of scalars, which are used to
      generate variable declarations and to remove unnecessary array bounds checking
      in the translated FORTRAN program. The second part is an extensible FORTRAN
      code generation framework automatically transforming MATLAB constructs to
      FORTRAN. This work has been implemented within the McLab framework, and we
      demonstrate the performance of the translated FORTRAN code on a collection of
      MATLAB benchmarks."

  type: "Paper" 
  abstract: "This paper presents a modular approach to implementing OSR for the
      LLVM compiler infrastructure. This is an important step forward because LLVM is
      gaining popular support, and adding the OSR capability allows compiler
      developers to develop new dynamic techniques. In particular, it will enable
      more sophisticated LLVM-based JIT compiler approaches. Indeed, other
      compiler/VM developers can use our approach because it is a clean modular
      addition to the standard LLVM distribution. Further, our approach is defined
      completely at the LLVM-IR level and thus does not require any modifications to
      the target code generation."

      MATLAB programs to a static language such as FORTRAN. This paper presents an
      extensible object-oriented toolkit for supporting the generation of static

- title: "Kind Analysis for MATLAB"
  link: "http://www.sable.mcgill.ca/publications/papers/2011-3/oopsla104-doherty.pdf" 
  type: "Paper" 
  abstract: "A fundamental problem in MATLAB is determining the kind of an
      identifier. Does an identifier refer to a variable, a named function or a
      prefix? Although this is a trivial problem for most programming languages, it
      was not clear how to do this properly in MATLAB. Furthermore, there was no
      simple explanation of kind analysis suitable for MATLAB programmers, nor a
      publicly-available implementation suitable for compiler researchers.

      This paper explains the required background of MATLAB, clarifies the kind
      assignment program, and proposes some general guidelines for developing good
      kind analyses. Based on these foundations we present our design and
      implementation of a variety of kind analyses, including an approach that
      matches the intended behaviour of modern MATLAB 7 and two potentially better
      alternatives."

      against a previously captured run-time type. Typings aspects can be deployed at
      three different levels,they can be used: (1) solely as documentation, (2) to
      log type errors or (3) to catch type errors at run-time.

  type: "Paper" 
  abstract: "Several aspects of the MATLAB language such as dynamic loading and

      the scientific communities, but at the same time provide many challenges to the
      compiler and virtual machine. One such problem, minimizing the number of copies
      and copy checks for Matlab programs has not received much attention. The
      classical approach to minimizing the number of copies (i.e., reference
      counting) does not work in a garbage-collected virtual machine. This paper
      presents a staged static analysis approach that does not require reference
      counts, thus enabling a garbage-collected virtual machine."

  link: "http://www.sable.mcgill.ca/publications/thesis/master-xli141/sable-thesis-2014-master-xuli.pdf" 
  type: "Thesis" 
  abstract: "MATLAB is a dynamic numerical scripting language widely used by
    scientists, engineers and students. While MATLAB's high-level syntax and
    dynamic types make it ideal for fast prototyping, programmers often prefer
    using high-performance static languages such as FORTRAN for their final
    distribution. Rather than rewriting the code by hand, our solution is to
    provide a source-to-source compiler that translates the original MATLAB program
    to an equivalent MATLAB program.


    In this thesis, we introduce MC2FOR, a source-to-source compiler which
    transforms MATLAB to FORTRAN and handles several important challenges during
    the transformation, such as efficiently estimating the static type
    characteristics of all the variables in a given MATLAB program, mapping
    numerous MATLAB built-in functions to FORTRAN, and correctly supporting some
    MATLAB dynamic features in the generated FORTRAN code.


    This compiler consists of two major parts. The first part is an interprocedural
    analysis component to estimate the static type characteristics, such as the
    shapes of the arrays and the ranges of the scalars, which are used to generate
    variable declarations and to remove unnecessary array bounds checking in the
    translated FORTRAN program. The second part is an extensible FORTRAN code
    generation framework automatically transforming MATLAB constructs to equivalent
    FORTRAN constructs.


    This work has been implemented within the McLab framework, and we evaluated the
    performance of the Mc2For compiler on a collection of 20 MATLAB benchmarks.
    For most of the benchmarks, the generated FORTRAN program runs 1.2 to 337 times
    faster than the original MATLAB program, and in terms of physical lines of
    code, typically grows only by a factor of around 2. These experimental results
    show that the code generated by Mc2For performs better on average, at the cost
    of only a modest increase in code size."

- title: "MiX10: Compiling MATLAB to X10 for high performance"
  link: "http://www.sable.mcgill.ca/publications/thesis/masters-vkumar/thesis.pdf" 
  type: "Thesis" 
  abstract: "MATLAB is a popular dynamic array-based language commonly used by
      students, scientists and engineers who appreciate the interactive development
      style, the rich set of array operators, the extensive builtin library, and the
      fact that they do not have to declare static types. Even though these users
      like to program in MATLAB, their computations are often very compute-intensive
      and are better suited for emerging high performance computing systems. This
      thesis reports on MIX10, a source-to-source compiler that automatically
      translates MATLAB programs to X10, a language designed for “Performance and
      Productivity at Scale\"; thus, helping scientific programmers make better use
      of high performance computing systems. There is a large semantic gap between
      the array-based dynamically-typed nature of MATLAB and the object-oriented,
      statically-typed, and high-level array abstractions of X10. This thesis
      addresses the major challenges that must be overcome to produce sequential X10
      code that is competitive with state-of-the-art static compilers for MATLAB
      which target more conventional imperative languages such as C and Fortran.
      Given that efficient basis, the thesis then provides a translation for the
      MATLAB parfor construct that leverages the powerful concurrency constructs in
      X10. The MIX10 compiler has been implemented using the McLab compiler tools, is
      open source, and is available both for compiler researchers and end-user MATLAB
      programmers. We have used the implementation to perform many empirical
      measurements on a set of 17 MATLAB benchmarks. We show that our best
      MIX10-generated code is significantly faster than the de facto Mathworks’
      MATLAB system, and that our results are competitive with state-of-the-art
      static compilers that target C and Fortran. We also show the importance of
      finding the correct approach to representing the arrays in X10, and the
      necessity of an IntegerOkay analysis that determines which double variables can
      be safely represented as integers. Finally, we show that our X10-based handling
      of the MATLAB parfor greatly outperforms the de facto MATLAB implementation."

  link: "http://www.sable.mcgill.ca/publications/thesis/phd-nlameed/thesis-phd-2013-nlameed.pdf" 
  type: "Thesis" 
  abstract: "MATLAB has gained widespread acceptance among engineers and
      scientists. Several aspects of the language such as dynamic loading and typing,
      safe updates, copy semantics for arrays, and support for higher-order functions
      contribute to its appeal, but at the same time provide many challenges to the
      compiler and virtual machine. MATLAB is a dynamic language. Traditional
      implementations of the language use interpreters and have been found to be too
      slow for large computations. More recently, researchers and software developers
      have been developing JIT compilers for MATLAB and other dynamic languages. This
      thesis is about the development of new compiler analyses and transformations
      for a MATLAB JIT compiler, McJIT, which is based on the LLVM JIT compiler
      toolkit.

      The new contributions include a collection of novel analyses for optimizing
      copying of arrays, which are performed when a function is first compiled. We
      designed and imple- mented four analyses to support an efficient implementation
      of array copy semantics in a MATLAB JIT compiler. Experimental results show
      that copy optimization is essential for performance improvement in a compiler
      for the MATLAB language.


      We also developed a variety of new dynamic analyses and code transformations
      for optimizing running code on-the-fly according to the current conditions of
      the runtime en- vironment. LLVM does not currently support on-the-fly code
      transformation. So, we first developed a new on-stack replacement approach for
      LLVM. This capability allows the run- time stack to be modified during the
      execution of a function, thus enabling a continuation of the execution at a
      higher optimization level. We then used the on-stack replacement implementation
      to support selective inlining of function calls in long-running loops. Our
      experimental results show that function calls in long-running loops can result
      in high run- time overhead, and that selective dynamic inlining can be used to
      drastically reduce this overhead.


      The built-in function feval is an important MATLAB feature for certain classes
      of numerical programs and solvers which benefit from having functions as
      parameters. Pro- grammers may pass a function name or function handle to the
      solver and then the solver uses feval to indirectly call the function. In this
      thesis, we show that although feval provides an acceptable abstraction
      mechanism for these types of applications, there are significant performance
      overheads for function calls via feval, in both MATLAB inter- preters and JITs.
      The thesis then proposes, implements and compares two on-the-fly mech- anisms
      for specialization of feval calls. The first approach uses our on-stack
      replacement technology. The second approach specializes calls of functions with
      feval using a combi- nation of runtime input argument types and values.
      Experimental results on seven numerical solvers show that the techniques
      provide good performance improvements.


      The implementation of all the analyses and code transformations presented in
      this thesis has been done within the McLab virtual machine, McVM, and is
      available to the public as open source software."

  type: "Thesis" 
  abstract: "MATLAB is a very popular dynamic \"scripting\" language for
      numerical computations used by scientists, engineers and students world-wide.
      MATLAB programs are often developed incrementally using a mixture of MATLAB
      scripts and functions and frequently build upon existing code which may use
      outdated features. This results in programs that could benefit from
      refactoring, especially if the code will be reused and/or distributed. Despite
      the need for refactoring there appear to be no MATLAB refactoring tools
      available. Correct refactoring of MATLAB is quite challenging because of its
      non-standard rules for binding identifiers. Even simple refactorings are
      non-trivial. Compiler writers and software engineers are generally not familiar
      with MATLAB and how it is used so the problem has been left untouched so far.
      This thesis has two main contributions. The first is McBench, a tool that helps
      compiler writers understand the language better. In order to have a systematic
      approach to the problem, we developed this tool to give us some insight about
      how programmers use MATLAB. The second contribution is a suite of
      semantic-preserving refactoring for MATLAB functions and scripts including:
      function and script inlining, converting scripts to functions, extracting new
      functions, and converting dynamic feval calls to static function calls. These
      refactorings have been implemented using the McLAB compiler framework, and an
      evaluation is given on a large set of MATLAB programs which demonstrates the
      effectiveness of our approach."

  link: "http://www.sable.mcgill.ca/publications/techreports/2014-1/techrep.pdf" 
  type: "Technical Report" 
  abstract: "Matlab is a popular dynamic array-based language commonly used by
      students, scientists and engineers who appreciate the interactive development
      style, the rich set of array operators, the extensive builtin library, and the
      fact that they do not have to declare static types. Even though these users
      like to program in Matlab, their computations are often very compute- intensive
      and are better suited for emerging high performance computing systems. This
      paper reports on MiX10, a source-to-source compiler that automatically
      translates Matlab programs to X10, a language designed for “Performance and
      Productivity at Scale”; thus, helping scientific programmers make better use of
      high performance computing systems. There is a large semantic gap between the
      array-based dynamically-typed nature of Matlab and the object-oriented,
      statically-typed, and high-level array abstractions of X10. This paper
      addresses the major challenges that must be overcome to produce sequential X10
      code that is competitive with state-of-the-art static compilers for Matlab
      which target more conventional imperative languages such as C and Fortran.
      Given that efficient basis, the paper then provides a translation for the
      Matlab parfor construct that leverages the powerful concurrency constructs in
      X10. The MiX10 compiler has been implemented using the McLab compiler tools, is
      open source, and is available both for compiler researchers and end-user Matlab
      programmers. We have used the implementation to perform many empirical
      measurements on a set of 17 Matlab benchmarks. We show that our best
      MiX10-generated code is significantly faster than the de facto Mathworks’
      Matlab system, and that our results are competitive with state-of-the-art
      static compilers that target C and Fortran. We also show the importance of
      finding the correct approach to representing the arrays in X10, and the
      necessity of an IntegerOkay analysis that determines which double variables can
      be safely represented as integers. Finally, we show that our X10-based handling
      of the Matlab parfor greatly outperforms the de facto Matlab implementation."

  abstract: "Developing compilers that allow scientific programmers to use
      multicores and GPUs is of increasing interest, however building such compilers
      requires considerable effort. We present Velociraptor: a portable compiler
      toolkit that can be used to easily build compilers for numerical programs
      targeting multicores and GPUs. Velociraptor provides a new high-level IR called
      VRIR which has been specifically designed for numeric computations, with rich
      support for arrays, plus support for high-level parallel and accelerator
      constructs. A compiler developer uses Velociraptor by generating VRIR for key
      parts of an input program. Velociraptor does the rest of the work by optimizing
      the VRIR code, and generating LLVM for CPUs and OpenCL for GPUs. Velociraptor
      also provides a smart runtime system to manage GPU resources and task dispatch.
      To demonstrate Velociraptor in action, we present two case studies: a
      proof-of-concept Python compiler targeting CPUs and GPUs, and a GPU extension
      for a MATLAB JIT."

  type: "Technical Report" 
  abstract: "MATLAB is a dynamic numerical scripting language widely used by
      scientists, engineers and students. While MATLAB's high-level syntax and
      dynamic types makes it ideal for prototyping, programmers often prefer using
      high-performance static programming languages such as Fortran for their final
      distributable code. Rather than requiring programmers to rewrite their code by
      hand, our solution is to provide a tool that automatically translates the
      original MATLAB program to produce an equivalent Fortran program. There are
      several important challenges for automatically translating MATLAB to Fortran,
      such as correctly estimating the static type characteristics of all the
      variables in a MATLAB program, mapping MATLAB built-in functions, and
      effectively mapping MATLAB constructs to Fortran constructs. In this paper, we
      introduce Mc2For, a tool which automatically translates MATLAB to Fortran. This
      tool consists of two major parts. The first part is an interprocedural analysis
      component to estimate the static type characteristics, such as array shape and
      the range value information, which are used to generate variable declarations
      in the translated Fortran program. The second part is an extensible Fortran
      code generation framework to automatically transform MATLAB constructs to
      corresponding Fortran constructs. This work has been implemented within the
      McLab framework, and we demonstrate the performance of the translated Fortran
      code for a collection of MATLAB benchmark programs."

  type: "Technical Report" 
  abstract: "MATLAB is a popular dynamically-typed array-based language. The
      built-in function feval is an important MATLAB feature for certain classes of
      numerical programs and solvers which benefit from having functions as
      parameters. Programmers may pass a function name or function handle to the
      solver and then the solver uses feval to indirectly call the function. In this
      paper, we show that although feval provides an acceptable abstraction mechanism
      for these types of applications, there are significant performance overheads
      for function calls via feval, in both MATLAB interpreters and JITs. The paper
      then proposes, implements and compares two on-the-fly mechanisms for
      specialization of feval calls. The first approach specializes calls of
      functions with feval using a combination of runtime input argument types and
      values. The second approach uses on-stack replacement technology, as supported
      by McVM/McOSR. Experimental results on seven numerical solvers show that the
