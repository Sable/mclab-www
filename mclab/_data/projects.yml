###################### Analysis Tools #############################
- name: "McSAF"
  category: "Analysis Tools"
  link: "/projects/mcsaf/"
  status: "ongoing"
  description: "In order for a compiler to perform optimizations or to provide
      feedback to programmers, it must analyze the program source code. Making such
      analyses easier to write requires a simple, well-defined Intermediate
      Representation (IR) and analysis framework. This framework should also allow
      new language extensions to use and adapt existing analyses. In spite of
      MATLAB’s popularity, and the apparent need for static analysis, there has been
      no publicly available framework for creating static analyses for the M ATLAB
      programming language. The McLAB Static Analysis Framework, or McSAF is such a
      framework. McSAF was created as part of the Mc L AB project to satisfy these
      requirements. The goal of the framework is to make new analyses easy to write
      and easy to extend to new language features."

  description: "Our open source toolkit, called the MATLAB Tamer, targets a
      large subset of MATLAB. Given information about the entry point of the program,
      the MATLAB Tamer builds a complete callgraph, transforms every function into a
      reduced intermediate representation, and provides typing information to aid the
      generation of static code."

  status: "unmaintained"
  description: "We apply profile-based training runs to determine likely
      loop-bounds ranges for which specialized versions of the loops may be
      generated. The main idea is to collect information about observed loop bounds
      and hot loops using training data which is then used to heuristically decide
      upon which loops and which ranges are worth specializing using a variety of
      loop transformation. This project is no longer maintained."

      and an optimizing JIT compiler called McJIT supporting a non-trivial subset of the MATLAB
      programming language. The primary objective of this project is to serve as a
      platform to help researchers explore both static and dynamic optimization

  description: "On-stack replacement (OSR) is a technique that allows a virtual
      machine to interrupt running code during the execution of a function/method, to
      re-optimize the function on-the-fly using an optimizing JIT compiler, and then
      to resume the interrupted function at the point and state at which it was
      interrupted. OSR is particularly useful for programs with potentially
      long-running loops, as it allows dynamic optimization of those loops as soon as
      they become hot. "

  description: "Velociraptor is a compiler toolkit consisting of a code
      generation library as well as a runtime system. It takes as input a high-level

      semantics of many different languages. VRIR is a typed AST based representation
      that is easy to generate, and has built-in operators for many high-level array
      operations (like matrix multiplication), flexible array indexing schemes, and
      array layouts. Velociraptor generates LLVM for CPUs and OpenCL for GPUs, making
      it portable across many different systems. Velociraptor is accompanied by its
      intelligent runtime system, that is designed for maximizing throughput in
      hybrid systems by doing operations in parallel and by minimizing redundant data

  status: "ongoing"
  description: "RaijinCL is a high-performance, portable libary for
      implementing many matrix operations on the GPU such as matrix multiplication
      and reductions. It is difficult to write a single OpenCL code that works well
      everywhere. Therefore, RaijinCL does autotuning, a process where it tests
      hundreds of different versions of important functions and records the best one
      found on a user's machine. Initial results are encouraging, and we are able to
      match the performance of vendor libraries on some systems, and deliver good
      performance everywhere. RaijinCL currently consists of GEMM-inspired (GEMM =
      general matrix multiply) routines, reduction routines for calulating sum and
      product of elements of multidimensional arrays along a particular axis as well
      as several element-wise operations on strided multidimensional arrays. We are
      also looking into more routines such as matrix decomposition."
