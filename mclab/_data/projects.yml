###################### Analysis Tools #############################
- name: "McFlat" 
  category: "Analysis Tools"
  link: "/projects/mcflat/"
  status: "unmaintained"
  description: "We apply profile-based training runs to determine likely
      loop-bounds ranges for which specialized versions of the loops may be
      generated. The main idea is to collect information about observed loop bounds
      and hot loops using training data which is then used to heuristically decide
      upon which loops and which ranges are worth specializing using a variety of
      loop transformation. This project is no longer maintained."

  description: "Our open source toolkit, called the MATLAB Tamer, targets a
      large subset of MATLAB. Given information about the entry point of the program,

  status: "ongoing"
  description: "The McVM virtual machine currently integrates an interpreter
      and an optimizing JIT compiler called McJIT supporting a non-trivial subset of the MATLAB
      programming language. The primary objective of this project is to serve as a
      platform to help researchers explore both static and dynamic optimization
      techniques for dynamic scientific languages. A secondary objective of the
      project is to make McVM a viable alternative implementation of the language for
      those who use MATLAB for scientific computing."

- name: "Velociraptor"
  category: "Parallel Scientific Computing"
  link: "http://www.sable.mcgill.ca/mclab/gpu/index.html"
  status: "ongoing"
  description: "Velociraptor is a compiler toolkit consisting of a code
      generation library as well as a runtime system. It takes as input a high-level
      IR called Velociraptor IR (VRIR for short) that is designed to accomodate array
      semantics of many different languages. VRIR is a typed AST based representation
      that is easy to generate, and has built-in operators for many high-level array
      operations (like matrix multiplication), flexible array indexing schemes, and
      array layouts. Velociraptor generates LLVM for CPUs and OpenCL for GPUs, making
      it portable across many different systems. Velociraptor is accompanied by its
      intelligent runtime system, that is designed for maximizing throughput in
      hybrid systems by doing operations in parallel and by minimizing redundant data
      transfers."

  category: "Parallel Scientific Computing"

  status: "ongoing"
  description: "RaijinCL is a high-performance, portable libary for
      implementing many matrix operations on the GPU such as matrix multiplication
      and reductions. It is difficult to write a single OpenCL code that works well
      everywhere. Therefore, RaijinCL does autotuning, a process where it tests
      hundreds of different versions of important functions and records the best one
      found on a user's machine. Initial results are encouraging, and we are able to
      match the performance of vendor libraries on some systems, and deliver good
      performance everywhere. RaijinCL currently consists of GEMM-inspired (GEMM =
      general matrix multiply) routines, reduction routines for calulating sum and
      product of elements of multidimensional arrays along a particular axis as well
      as several element-wise operations on strided multidimensional arrays. We are
      also looking into more routines such as matrix decomposition."
