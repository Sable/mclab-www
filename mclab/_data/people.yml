  description: "This is the fourth big compiler project I have led. In the past
      my research groups have worked on (i) optimizing/parallelizing C (McCAT), (ii)
      optimizing and analyzing Java (Soot); and a compiler toolkit for language
      extensions and optimizations for AspectJ (abc).


      Building on those previous experiences, McLab is an exciting new project where
      our goal is to bring together what we have learned about static optimizations,
      virtual machines, and extensible compiler frameworks to the domain of dynamic
      scientific languages. Our intent is to work with scientists to develop
      languages that provide good programming models and good execution performance."

      I currently focus on Java, and have particular interests in concurrency in
      optimization, use of speculation, and practical information flow; (ii)
      concurrency, both in terms of compilation issues, and theoretical/linguistic
      models; and (iii)modern computer games which are woefully under-analyzed."

      the code can also be executed on the fast developing platforms for Java and

Analysis and Transformation engine computes dependence between loop statements and apply various loop transformations that could improve the performance of programs. In MatLab the loop bounds are mostly determined at run time,so the profiler component of analysis and transformation engine generates data for different runs of the program.The data is then passed to heuristic engine to estimate appropriate ranges for loops in the program. Dependence Analysis and transformations are applied on the estimated ranges. The focus of my thesis is to avoid expensive run time dependence analysis tests and do most of the computations at compile time."
